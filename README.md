## Description

This project uses command line inputs from a user to generate a `.svg` file with a logo. This can be used to save time and money from hiring a graphic designer

## Installation

Use `npm i` to install all dependencies for this project.

## Usage

To use this app, run the code `node index`. This will prompt the user to enter text up to 3 characters long, a text color, a shape from the list of `circle, quare, or triangle`, and a color for the shape. Once these are input, a file will generate called `logoGen.svg`.
